The virtualspecies R package


This package provides a user-friendly framework for generating virtual species distribution, integrating the existing methodological approaches.
The package includes (1) generating virtual speciesâ€™ suitability from a spatial set of environmental conditions, with two different approaches; (2) converting the environmental suitability into presence-absence with a probabilistic approach; (3) introducing dispersal limitations in the realised virtual species distributions and (4) sampling occurrences with different biases in the sampling procedure.
